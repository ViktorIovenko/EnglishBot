**Hello everyone!**

Today I want to tell you about a tool that helps me learn English. It’s a Telegram bot that I wrote myself. I study English with a private teacher via Google Meet. The teacher doesn't use any specific platforms for the lessons, so there was a need to automate some processes. The bot solves the following main tasks:

1. Assigning homework.
2. Reminding the teacher to assign homework.
3. Reminding me to complete the homework.

Before starting the lessons, we selected two English textbooks in PDF format that we are working with. The bot helps the teacher assign homework and reminds me to complete it. Here are the steps the bot takes:

1. Reminds the teacher to assign homework.
2. Asks which textbook the homework will be from.
3. Asks for the page number.
4. Asks for the specific task.
5. Posts an image of the page with the homework written on it in the study group in Telegram.
6. Reminds me to complete the homework.
7. Resets and updates the homework status every week, as the lessons are weekly.

You can use my code and customize the bot’s notifications to suit your needs. The most challenging part was converting pages from PDF to JPEG. I have been studying with the teacher for a year, and the bot has helped me stay disciplined and not forget about self-study.
